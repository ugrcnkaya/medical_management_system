## Back-End Only Development Repository

Please keep using the previous one for back-end UI developments, I had to set this repository in order to provide you easier IDE Run when you use PCharm, it will read all the profile settings so we all have same debug/identifiers etc.


Whenever main branch is pushed, deploy runs on digitaloceain container.
